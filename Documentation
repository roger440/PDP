    The purpose of this laboratory is to find an N coloring of a graph using threads.
The input consists of a series of inter-connected nodes, representing an edge
between the two nodes.
    Using a 'first fit' method, the algorithm should first establish a possible coloring, then
using a validator, it could possibly change the initial coloring if it finds it to be invalid.
    There are several threads trying do do the coloring, their number can be specified as a constant.
